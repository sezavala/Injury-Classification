🚗 Car Accidents Injury Classification
This project explores whether injury severity in traffic crashes can be predicted based on environmental and crash-related conditions like weather, lighting, and vehicle damage. Using a publicly available dataset from the Maryland Open Crash Reporting System, we build and evaluate machine learning models to classify injury outcomes.

📊 Project Goals
Predict Injury Severity: Build ML models to classify injury severity in car crashes.

Identify Risk Factors: Analyze how different conditions (e.g., weather, driver behavior) influence injury risk.

Potential Applications:

Help inform safer driving practices.

Provide early injury likelihood estimates for concerned family members.

Explore data-driven approaches for crash risk assessment.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Data Source: Montgomery County Open Data – Crash Reporting – Drivers Data

📁 Project Structure
Injury-Classification.ipynb: Main notebook with data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

data/: (optional) Folder for storing cleaned datasets or extracted features.

README.md: Project overview and setup instructions.

📈 Key Features
Extensive EDA and visualization of crash and injury data

Feature cleaning and reduction (handling categorical imbalance and missing values)

One-hot encoding and scaling

Supervised learning models for multi-class injury prediction

(Optional) Unsupervised learning exploration for extra credit

🔒 Ethics & Considerations
While predictive models can support driver safety and awareness, they should not replace expert crash investigations or medical evaluations. Model outputs are probabilistic and should be used cautiously.
